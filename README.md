This code appears to be a JavaScript code that controls a web page that displays and shares Islamic hadiths. It contains functions that allow the user to generate a random hadith, share it on social media platforms, listen to the hadith using text-to-speech, and copy the hadith to the clipboard.

The code uses the fetch() method to retrieve data from an external API that provides a collection of hadiths. The code then selects a random hadith from the data returned by the API and displays it on the web page.

The code also includes event listeners that trigger functions when the user clicks on various buttons, such as the "share" button for sharing the hadith on social media platforms, the "zvuk" button for listening to the hadith using text-to-speech, and the "kopiraj" button for copying the hadith to the clipboard.

The code also includes functions for sharing the hadith on various social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Messenger, and email. These functions use the navigator.share() method to allow the user to share the hadith text and a link to the page.
